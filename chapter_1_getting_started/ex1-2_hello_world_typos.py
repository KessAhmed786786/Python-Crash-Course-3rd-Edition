# ex1-2_hello_world_typos.py
# Open the hello_world.py file you just created. Make a typo somewhere in the line and run the program again. Can you make a typo that generates an error? Can you make sense of the error message? Can you make a typo that doesn’t generate an error? Why do you think it didn’t make an error?

print("Hello World")
# SyntaxError: unterminated string literal (detected at line 6)
# Missing " closing the string literal

print("Hello Worl")
# Works
# Missing letters are not spelled checked, syntax is correct for python because enclosed in double ""
