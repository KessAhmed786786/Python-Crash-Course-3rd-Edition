Importing an Entire Module
- Storing functions in a seperate file allows you to hide details
- Import allows you to make use of external functions
- Use import to import .py files

EXAMPLE:

module_name_py.function_name()

Importing Specific Functions
- You can limit to only one or couple functions rather than the whole set of functions 
- Seperate commas for many functions
- No . needed becauese it is explicit which function we used to import

EXAMPLE:

from module_name import function_name_0, function_name_1

Using as to Give a Function an Alias
- When Importing you can nickname your imported function, for when long name or duplicate name 

EXAMPLE:

from pizza import make_pizza as mp
from module_name import function_name as fn

Using as to Give a Module an Alias
- Same nicknames for modules entierly

EXAMPLE: 

import pizza as p

Importing All Functions in a Module
- Import the whole function list without having to spell the moduel name all the time
- Can overwrite the same named function so use carefully

EXAMPLE: 

from pizza import *
