Mixing Positional and Arbitrary Arguments 
- Won't know ahead of time how many arguments you need
- Allows you collect an arbitrary number of arguments from the calling statement
- Pizza, many unknown items that will be passed depending

EXAMPLE: 

def make_pizza(*toppings):
    """Print the list of toppings that have been requested"""
    print(toppings)

make_pizza('pepperoni')
make_pizza('peppers', 'mushrooms', 'cheese')

- Basically, make a tuple called toppings following asterisk which can be looped
- Order, when using arbitrary with other argument types
- Positional, keyword, arbitrary

EXAMPLE:

def make_pizz(size, *toppings):
    print(f"Pizza, {size}-inch:)
    for topping in toppings:
        print(topping)

- Generic *args parameter

Using Arbitrary Keyword Arguments 
- Use **user_info to indicate key value pairings, builds a dictionary
- Generic **kwargs

EXAMPLE:

def build_profile(first, last, **user_info):
    user_info['first_name'] = first
    user_info['first_name'] = last
    return user_info

user_profile = build_profile('albert', 'einstein', location='princeton', field='physics')
