# Chapter 3 - Introducing Lists
# ex3-2_greetings.py
# Start with the list you used in Exercise 3-1, but instead of just printing each person’s name, print a message to them. The text of each message should be the same, but each message should be personalized with the person’s name.

# Create a list called names
names = ['John', 'Casey', 'Griff', 'Daniel', 'Haseeb']

# Print each item in the list, no loop
print(f"Yo, what's up {names[0]}")
print(f"Yo, what's up {names[1]}")
print(f"Yo, what's up {names[2]}")
print(f"Yo, what's up {names[3]}")
print(f"Yo, what's up {names[4]}")
