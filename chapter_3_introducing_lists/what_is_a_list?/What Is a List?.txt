What is a List?
- List, a collection of items in a particular order
- Can contain, letters, digits, names basically anything and even unrelated
- Example: bicycles = ['trek', 'redline']
- Printing a list, the whole list is done

Accessing Elements in a List
- Access by using the position, Index
- Example: print(bicycle[0])
- Can use string methods because, this element is a string
- Example: print(bicycle[0].title())

Index Positions Start at 0, Not 1
- Position 0 begins, not 1
- Keep note, as to avoid off by one error
- Access the final item in a list by using -1
- Example: print(bicycles[-1])
- Works by simply, -2, 2nd to last, -3, 3rd to last

Using Individual Values from a List
- Use in obtaining items from a list, performing methods
- Forming f-string and printing message
Example: message = f"My first bicycle was a {bicycle[0].title()}."
