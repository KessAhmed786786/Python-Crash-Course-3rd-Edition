Modifying Elements in a List
- Most list you will create a dynamic, build a list add and remove elements as the program runs
- Changing values example: motorcycles[0] = 'ducati'
- Chnage any item, with any index

Adding Elements in a List
- Use append to add items to list, at the end
- Appending example: motorcycles.append('ducati')
- Can start empty and add items over time in program
- Add not just end, insert at any position
- Insert example: motorcycles.insert(0, 'ducati')

Removing Elements from a List
- Remove any item at any position based on position
- del example: del motorcycles[0]
- Removing an item using the pop() method 
- Remove the last item in a stack and use that item 
- pop() example: last_owned = motorcycles.pop()
- pop() can be used throughout the list any position 
- example: first_owned = motorcycles.pop(0)
- Removing an item by value, know the value, unknown position
- remove example: motorcycles.remove('ducati')
- note: only removes first instances, if more, need loop
