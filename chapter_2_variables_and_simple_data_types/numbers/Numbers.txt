Integers
- add +
- subtract - 
- mutliply *
- divide /
- exponents **
- brackets () order control

Floats
- Decimal point number : 2.2
- Handles decimal numbers no matter where the decimal position is 
- Same operations as integers
- 0.2 + 0.1 = 0.30000000000000004 - computer logic, near zero accuracy

Integers and Floats
- Any division float or integer, results in float
- Mix any integer with a float, results in float
- Python defaults to a float in any operation that uses a float, even if the
output is whole number

Underscores in Numbers
- Longer numbers can group digits using underscore: universe_age: 14_000_000_000_000
- Printing underscored number, results in underscores removed: 14000000000000
- Works with both floats, integers and can have _ anywhere: 1_000, 10_00

Multiple Assignment
- Shorten programs by assigning on a single line, used to intialize a set
- x, y, z = 0, 0, 0
- Make sure the same number is on either end seperated by commas

Constants
- Value that stays the same throughout the program lifetime
- No built-in constant type, however use capitals to indicate it 
- MAX_CONNECTOINS = 5000
