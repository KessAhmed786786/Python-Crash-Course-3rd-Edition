Simple if Statements
- One test, one action is the simplest
- Example: if condtional_test: do something
- Indentation matters

if-else Statements 
- Defines actions or an action to take if the test fails
- Example: else: print("Something else was done")
- Good for 2 possible actions

The if-elif-else Chain 
- Good for mutiple situations
- Runs down the structure until one satisfies the statement and executing that part only, skipping others
- Example: if age < 4, elif age < 18, else: 
- If printing statements that are similiar, change the value in the if-elif-else blocks, and print to one line

Using Mutiple elif Blocks
- You can chain together multiple elif blocks
- Be wary of code execution, and know what the else will be beforehand

Omitting the else Block
- Sometimes it is clearer to remove the else
- Using a elif there is more clearer and expandable
- Else should be a catchall, when you haven't tested all options in the statements

Testing Mutiple Conditions
- Tests for one specific condtion, per: if-elif-else chain 
- Use multiple if's, when checking all conditions of interest, if testing if something is true for many
- One block use if-elif-else
- Many blocks use many if's
