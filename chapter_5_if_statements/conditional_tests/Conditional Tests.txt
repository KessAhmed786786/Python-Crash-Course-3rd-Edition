Checking for Equality 
- Boiled down to an expression that can be evaluated as True or False, condtional test
- If True, it is executed, if False it is not 
- Equality, check if value of variable is equal to another value using ==
- Example: car == 'bmw', True, car =='audi', False

Ignoring Case When Checking for Equality
- Capital letters matter, make sure they are same
- Can use string methods to convert to comparable, without changing the value itself

Checking for Inequality
- Check if they are not the same using, !=
- Example: if requested_topping != 'anchovies':

Numerical Comparisons
- Use the same == and != with numbers
- You can also use numerical: <, <=, >, >=

Checking Mulitple Conditions
- You sometimes want both or just one. AND and OR
- Example: age_0 >= 21 and age_1 >= 21, False
- Paratheneses can be used but not required
- Example: age_0 >= 21 and age_1 >= 21, True

Checking Whether a Value Is In a List
- Check if a value is already in a list, using in
- Example: 'mushrooms' in requested_toppings, True

Checking Whether a Value is Not in a List
- Check if a value is not in a list, using not 
- Example: if user not in banned_users:, True

Boolean Expressions
- Another way of saying conditional test, assign True or False
- Example: game_active = True
