Defining a Tuple
- Lists can change, Tuples cannot change (immutable)
- Declare just list a list, except using () not []
- Example: dimensions = (200, 50)
- If trying to reassign, TypeError: tuple object does not support item assignment

Looping Through All Values in a Tuple
- Works the same as a list
- Example: for dimension in dimensions: print (dimension)

Writing Over a Tuple
- You cannot modify values in the tuple, but can reassign the old tuple name to a new one
- dimensions = (200,50), dimensions = (400,100)
