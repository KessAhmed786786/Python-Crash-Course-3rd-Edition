Slicing a List
- Before, single elements and all elements, now part of elements
- Similar to range, stops before the 2nd integer, formatted using a colon within the []
- Example: print(players[0:3])
- Can begin anywhere in the list
- Omit the first element and it automatically begins at the start 
- Example: print(players[:3])
- Similar when starting in the middle and getting all elements until end
- Example: print(players[2:])
- If you want the last three elements use negatives
- Example: print(players[-3:])

Looping Through a Slice
- Loop through a subset
- Example: for player in players[:3]:

Copying a List
- Uses a slice, from the start to end to copy over, without specifiying the indicies
- Example: friend_foods = my_foods[:]
- This doesn't work, as both point to the original list
- Example: friend_foods = my_foods
