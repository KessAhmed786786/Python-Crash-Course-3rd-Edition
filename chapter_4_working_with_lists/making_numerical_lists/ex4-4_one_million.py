# Chapter 4 - Working with Lists
# Make a list of the numbers from one to one million, and then use a for loop to print the numbers. (If the output is taking too long, stop it by pressing CTRL-C or by closing the output window.)

# Generate a list from 1 to 1,000,000
million = []
million = list(range(1, 1_000_000))

# Print each element using a for loop
thousand = list(range(1, 1_000))
for number in thousand:
    print(number)
