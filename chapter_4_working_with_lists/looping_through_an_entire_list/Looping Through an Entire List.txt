A Closer Look at Looping
- Using looping to repeat code thousands or millions of iterations
- Example: for magician in magicians: print(magician)
- Repeats the set of actions once, per item in the list 
- Use single and plural for defining the loop

Doing More Work Within a for Loop
- Use f-strings ot personalize
- Each indentend line within is execute once for each value in the list
- Helpful to end lines on \n to show neat groupings

Doing Something After a for Loop
- End with a summary print statement that is not indentend
