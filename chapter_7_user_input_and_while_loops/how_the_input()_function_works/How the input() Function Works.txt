Writing Clear Prompts
- Often problems are solved by entering a user's input 
- input(), function pauses your program and waits for the user to enter some text. It then assigns to a variable
- One argument, the prompt that will be displayed
- Example: message = input("Input here:")
- Easy actionable and simple to follow for an end user
- Add space after : to allow for cleaner input
- If prompt is longer, use multiple of the same variable
- Exapmle: prompt = "Yo", prompt += "\nHI" name = input(prompt)
- This is an example of a multiline string


Using int() to Accept Numerical Input
- input(), interprets all as strings, but what about int?
- Convert strings into integers
- Example: age = int(age)

The Modulo Operator
- Divides one number by another and returns the remainder
- Example: if number % 2 == 0: , else:
