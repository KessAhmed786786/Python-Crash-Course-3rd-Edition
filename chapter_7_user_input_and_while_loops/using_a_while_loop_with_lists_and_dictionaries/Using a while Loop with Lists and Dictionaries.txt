Moving Items from One List to Another
- One piece of info is quite basic, you need a list to gather pieces together from users to keep track
- Don't modify a list in a for loop 
- Using a while loop with lists and dictionaries allows you to collect, store and organize lots of input to examine and report on later
- Example: 2 lists, while unconfirmed_users: pop(), print, append to 2nd list.

Removing All Instances of Specific Values from a List
- Removing using remove() to remove a specific value 
- What about all instances of that specific value
- Use a while loop to remove that value many times
- Example: while 'cat' in pets: pets.remove('cat')

Filling a Dictionary with User Input
- You can prompt as much into a dictionary, key value pairs as many
- Example: variable inputs, name response
responses[name] = response
