A List of Dictionaries
- Nesting, when you nest a list in a dictionary or a dictionary in a list, basically a large object itself in another large object 
- Dictionary IN list
- List IN Dictionary
- Dictionary IN Dictionary
- You can do the following example of a dictionary of one item very detailed, which is found in a list of similar items
- Example: aliens = [alien_0, alien_1, alien_2]
- Use a range() to auto generate list items built from dictionaries
- Make sure all dictionaries follow the same stucture to loop quickly

A List a Dictionary 
- Useful if an item has many things that can be related to it but follows the same stucture as others
- Example: pizza = {'crust': 'thick', 'toppings': ['cheese','tomato'],}
- To access each list item in dictionary
- Example: for topping in pizza['topping']:
- Breaking up long strings
- Example: print("You ordered pizza " \n "with the following toppings:")
- Auto joins the two strings 

A Dictionary in a Dictionary

    print(f"\nUsername: {username}")
    full_name = f"{user_info['first'] {user_info['last']}}"
    location = user_info['location']
    print(f"\tFull name: {full_name.title()}")
